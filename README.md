# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: incorrect grouping. The original code attempts to group data by a field and calculate the sum, but a mistake in specifying the grouping key and summed field leads to inaccurate results.

## Bug Description
The `$group` stage of the aggregation pipeline is incorrectly implemented. The issue is in the selection of fields in the `$group` stage.  This leads to incorrect sums and consequently an inaccurate top 10 list.

## Solution
The solution corrects the `$group` stage to properly specify the grouping key and the field to be summed, resulting in the correct aggregation results.
